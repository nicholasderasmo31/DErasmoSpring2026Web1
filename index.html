<h3> Spring 2026 </h3>
 
<p> This is my second website but now I'm using a different platform called Visual Studio Code. I am a Emerging Media student at Hunter and I would like to have my own website and know how to create my own website with html or any other code. I am a Junior and plan to graduate Spring of 2027. I also want to get back my old website somehow, I was using a site called glitch which allowed me to see my code while looking at the website. I made a short game on it which was cool. I know how to use photoshop and learned after effects a little bit last semester.   </p>
