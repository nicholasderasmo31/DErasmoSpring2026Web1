        <h3>Early 20C, Mundaneum, Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine</h3>
        <p> The Mundaneum was an institution which aimed to gather together all the world's knowledge and classify it
            according to a system called the Universal Decimal Classification. It was developed at the turn of the 20th
            century by Belgian lawyers Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine. The Mundaneum has been identified as a
            milestone in the history of data collection and management,[1] and (somewhat more tenuously) as a precursor
            to the Internet.[2]

            In the 21st century, the Mundaneum is a non-profit organisation based in Mons, Belgium, that runs an
            exhibition space, website and archive, which celebrate the legacy of the original Mundaneum.[3]</p>
