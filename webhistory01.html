        <h3>Early 20C, Mundaneum, Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine</h3>
        <p> The Mundaneum was an institution which aimed to gather together all the world's knowledge and classify it
            according to a system called the Universal Decimal Classification. It was developed at the turn of the 20th
            century by Belgian lawyers Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine. The Mundaneum has been identified as a
            milestone in the history of data collection and management, and (somewhat more tenuously) as a precursor
            to the Internet. In the 21st century, the Mundaneum is a non-profit organisation based in Mons, Belgium,
            that runs an exhibition space, website and archive, which celebrate the legacy of the original Mundaneum.
            The Mundaneum was created in 1910, following an initiative begun in 1895 by Belgian lawyers Paul Otlet and
            Henri La Fontaine, as part of their work on documentation science. Otlet first called it the Palais
            Mondial ("World Palace"), and it occupied the left wing of the Cinquantenaire Palace, a government building
            in Brussels. Otlet and La Fontaine organized an International Conference of International Associations,
            which was the origin of the Union of International Associations (UIA).</p>

        <h3>1945, Menex, Vannevar Bush </h3>
        <p> A memex (a portmanteau of "memory" and "index") is a hypothetical electromechanical device for interacting
            with microform documents and described in Vannevar Bush's 1945 article "As We May Think". Bush envisioned
            the memex as a device in which individuals would compress and store all of their books, records, and
            communications, "mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility". The
            individual was supposed to use the memex as an automatic personal filing system, making the memex "an
            enlarged intimate supplement to his memory".The concept of the memex influenced the development of early
            hypertext systems and personal knowledge base software.The hypothetical implementation depicted by Bush for
            the purpose of concrete illustration was based upon a document bookmark list of static microfilm pages and
            lacked a true hypertext system, where
            parts of pages would have internal structure beyond the common textual format. In "As We May Think",
            Vannevar Bush describes a memex as an electromechanical device enabling individuals to develop and read a
            large self-contained research library, create and follow associative trails of links and personal
            annotations, and recall these trails at any time to share them with other researchers. </p>

        <h3>1960s, Project Xanadu "hypertext", ted nelson </h3>
        <p> Project Xanadu (/ˈzænəduː/ ZAN-ə-doo)[1] was the first hypertext project, founded in 1960 by Ted Nelson.
            Administrators of Project Xanadu have declared it superior to the World Wide Web, with the mission
            statement: "Today's popular software simulates paper. The World Wide Web (another imitation of paper)
            trivialises our original hypertext model with one-way ever-breaking links and no management of version or
            contents."Wired magazine published an article entitled "The Curse of Xanadu", calling Project Xanadu "the
            longest-running vaporware story in the history of the computer industry". The first attempt at
            implementation began in 1960, but it was not until 1998 that an incomplete implementation was released. A
            version described as "a working deliverable", OpenXanadu, was made available in 2014. Nelson's vision was
            for a "digital repository scheme for world-wide electronic publishing". Nelson states that the idea began in
            1960, when he was a student at Harvard University. He proposed a machine-language program which would store
            and display documents, together with the ability to perform edits. This was different from a word processor
            (which had not been invented yet) in that the functionality would have included visual comparisons of
            different versions of the document, a concept Nelson would later call "intercomparison".</p>

        <h3>1960s, The birth of the Internet, ARPANET </h3>

        <p>For the episode of the television series The Americans, see Arpanet (The Americans).
            The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was the first wide-area packet-switched network with
            distributed control and one of the first computer networks to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite. Both
            technologies became the technical foundation of the Internet. The ARPANET was established by the Advanced
            Research Projects Agency (now DARPA) of the United States Department of Defense. Building on the ideas of J.
            C. R. Licklider, Bob Taylor initiated the ARPANET project in 1966 to enable resource sharing between remote
            computers. Taylor appointed Larry Roberts as program manager. Roberts made the key decisions about the
            request for proposal to build the network. He incorporated Donald Davies' concepts and designs for packet
            switching, and sought input from Paul Baran. In 1969, ARPA awarded the contract to build the
            Interface Message Processors (IMPs) for the network to Bolt Beranek & Newman (BBN). The design was led
            by Bob Kahn who developed the first protocol for the network. Roberts engaged Leonard Kleinrock at UCLA to
            develop mathematical methods for analyzing the packet network technology. </p>

        <h3>1971, First Email, Ray Tomlinson, </h3>

        <p>Raymond Samuel Tomlinson (April 23, 1941 – March 5, 2016) was an American computer programmer who
            invented the first email program on the ARPANET system, the precursor to the Internet, in 1971;
            it was the first system able to send mail between users on different hosts connected to ARPANET. Previously,
            mail could be sent only to others who used the same computer. To achieve this, he used the @ sign to
            separate the username from the name of their machine, a scheme which has been used in email addresses ever
            since. The Internet Hall of Fame in its account of his work commented "Tomlinson's email program brought
            about a complete revolution, fundamentally changing the way people communicate."He is credited with the
            invention of the TCP three-way handshake which underlies HTTP and many other key Internet protocols.
            Tomlinson was born in Amsterdam, New York, but his family soon moved to the small, unincorporated
            village of Vail Mills, Broadalbin, New York. His father Raymond Tomlinson worked in carpet mills and
            later worked in the grocery business. His mother Dorothy Tomlinson worked for a dry cleaner. He attended
            Broadalbin Central School in nearby Broadalbin, New York. Later he attended Rensselaer Polytechnic
            Institute (RPI) in Troy, New York, where he participated in the co-op program with IBM. He received a
            bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from RPI in 1963.

        <h3>1983,Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol, Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn </h3>

        <p>The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite. It
            originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol (IP).
            Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP. TCP provides reliable, ordered, and
            error-checked delivery of a stream of octets (bytes) between applications running on hosts communicating via
            an IP network. Major internet applications such as the World Wide Web, email, remote administration, file
            transfer and streaming media rely on TCP, which is part of the transport layer of the TCP/IP suite. SSL/TLS
            often runs on top of TCP. Today, TCP remains a core protocol for most Internet communication, ensuring
            reliable data transfer across diverse networks. TCP is connection-oriented, meaning that sender and receiver
            firstly need to establish a connection based on agreed parameters; they do this through a three-way
            handshake procedure. The server must be listening (passive open) for connection requests from clients
            before a connection is established. Three-way handshake (active open), retransmission, and error detection
            adds to reliability but lengthens latency. Applications that do not require reliable data stream service may
            use the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) instead, which provides a connectionless datagram service that
            prioritizes time over reliability. TCP employs network congestion avoidance. However, there are
            vulnerabilities in TCP, including denial of service, connection hijacking, TCP veto, and reset attack.</p>

        <h3>1989,Invention of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau at the European Council for
            Nuclear Research </h3>

        <p>The World Wide Web ("WWW", "W3" or simply "the Web") is a global information medium that users can access via
            computers connected to the Internet. The term is often used as a synonym for the Internet, but the Web is a
            service that operates over the Internet, just as email and videoconferencing do. The history of the Internet
            and the history of hypertext date back significantly further than that of the World Wide Web. Tim
            Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web while working at CERN in 1989. He proposed a "universal linked
            information system" using several concepts and technologies, the most fundamental of which was the
            connections that existed between information.He developed the first web server, the first web
            browser, and a document formatting protocol, called Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). After publishing the
            markup language in 1991, and releasing the browser source code for public use in 1993, many other web
            browsers were soon developed, with Marc Andreessen's Mosaic (later Netscape Navigator) being particularly
            easy to use and install, and often credited with sparking the Internet boom of the 1990s. It was a graphical
            browser which ran on several popular office and home computers, bringing multimedia content to non-technical
            users by including images and text on the same page. </p>

        <h3> 1990,Foundations of a website URL /HTTP/HTML/BROWSER, Tim Berners-Lee </h3>

        <p>Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee (born 8 June 1955), also known as TimBL, is an English computer scientist
            best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, HTML, the URL system, and HTTP. He is a professorial
            research fellow at the University of Oxford[2] and a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of
            Technology (MIT).Berners-Lee proposed an information management system on 12 March 1989 and implemented the
            first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the
            Internet in mid-November. He devised and implemented the first Web browser and Web server and helped
            foster the Web's subsequent development. He is the founder and emeritus director of the World Wide Web
            Consortium (W3C), which oversees the continued development of the Web. He co-founded (with Rosemary Leith)
            the World Wide Web Foundation. In 2009, he was elected Foreign Associate of the National Academy of
            Sciences. Berners-Lee was previously a senior researcher and holder of the 3Com founder's chair at the MIT
            Computer
            Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). He is a director of the Web Science Research
            Initiative and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective
            Intelligence. In 2011, he was named a member of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation. He
            is a founder and president of the Open Data Institute and is an advisor at social network MeWe. </p>

        <h3>1990, The first seach engine, Alan Entage Archie </h3>

        <p>Archie is a tool for indexing FTP archives, allowing users to more easily identify specific files. It is
            considered the first Internet search engine.The original implementation was written in 1990 by Alan
            Emtage, then a postgraduate student at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. Archie was
            superseded by other, more sophisticated search engines, including Jughead and Veronica, which were search
            engines for the Gopher protocol. These were in turn superseded by World Wide Web search engines like
            AltaVista and directories like Yahoo! in 1995. Work on Archie ceased in the late 1990s. A legacy Archie
            server was maintained for historic purposes in Poland at Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and
            Computational Modelling in the University of Warsaw until 2023. With assistance from the University of
            Warsaw, a new Archie server was created and opened for public access at The Serial Port, a web-based
            computer museum, on 11 May 2024. Archie first appeared in 1986, while Emtage was the systems manager at the
            McGill University School of
            Computer Science. His predecessor had attempted to persuade the institution to connect to the Internet, but
            due to the expensive cost — roughly $35,000 per year for a sluggish link to Boston — it had been challenging
            to persuade the appropriate parties that the investment was worthwhile </p>

        <h3>1992,The first photo on the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee </h3>


        <p>I.T. developer Silvano de Gennaro took the photo backstage at a music festival, edited it using the first
            version of Adobe Photoshop and saved the file as a GIF on his Macintosh. The description of how the photo
            came to be on the Internet can be found in an archive page of the CERN
            website. Back in 1992, after their show at the CERN Hardronic Festival, my colleague Tim Berners-Lee asked
            me for a
            few scanned photos of "the CERN girls" to publish them on some sort of information system he had just
            invented, called the "World Wide Web". I had only a vague idea of what that was, but I scanned some photos
            on my Mac and FTPed them to Tim's now famous "info.cern.ch". How was I to know that I was passing an
            historical milestone, as the one above was the first picture ever to be clicked on in a web browser! The
            exact date of the photo is questionable. The Telegraph reports that it was taken and uploaded on July 18,
            1992, but ABC News reports the exact date is "a bit murky." Comments at Wikipedia attributed to de Gennaro
            claim that there is no on upload date. </p>

        <h3>1997,The invention of Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11, Voc Hayes </h3>

        <p>Victor Hayes: Known as the father of WiFi, Victor “Vic” Hayes is a former researcher from the Delft
            University of Technology. Vic Hayes played an integral role in establishing the IEEE 802.11 Standards
            Working Group for Wireless Local Area Networks, which he also chaired. Hayes was an integral part of the
            development of IEEE 802.11 standards, including 802.11a, 802.11b, and
            802.11g. Hayes was also a key player in convincing authorities in Europe to dedicate radio spectrum to
            wireless LANs. IEEE 802.11 Standard: The IEEE 802.11 Standard is a set of protocol and rules for wireless
            local area networks (WLANs). Developed in the late 1990s, the IEEE 802.11 standard was originally published
            in 1997, although it has been updated many times in the years since to account for changes in technology and improve
            range and transmission rates. The IEEE 802.11 standard was originally based on a standard invented by AT&T
            and NCR Corporation in the Netherlands. The current standard in the series is IEEE 802.11ax, which is more
            commonly known as WiFi 6 or WiFi 6e. WiFi 7, also known as IEEE 802.11be, is expected to be widely available
            in 2025—an exciting prospect promising much faster data rates and significant improvements in bandwidth.</p>
