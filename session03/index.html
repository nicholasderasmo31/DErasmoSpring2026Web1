  <p> This is my second website but now I'm using a different platform called Visual Studio Code. I am a Emerging Media
    student at Hunter and I would like to have my own website and know how to create my own website with html or any
    other code. I am a Junior and plan to graduate Spring of 2027. I also want to get back my old website somehow, I was
    using a site called glitch which allowed me to see my code while looking at the website. I made a short game on it
    which was cool. I know how to use photoshop and learned after effects a little bit last semester. </p>
