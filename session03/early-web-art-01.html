    <h2> Characteristics of early web art</h2>

    <ul>

        <li>Interactivity and Participation

            <ul>
                <li>Early internet art required the viewer to become a participant, often transforming passive browsing
                    into active engagement. Works were rarely static; they were designed to be clicked, manipulated, or
                    altered by the user, making the audience a part of the creative process.</li>
            </ul>

        </li>


        <li> IMMATERIALITY AND VIRTUAL EXISTENCE

            <ul>
                <li>Early internet art required the viewer to become a participant, often transforming passive browsing
                    into active engagement. Works were rarely static; they were designed to be clicked, manipulated, or
                    altered by the user, making the audience a part of the creative process.</li>
            </ul>

        </li>

        <li> NETWORKABILITY AND CONNECTIVITY

            <ul>
                <li>Networkability and Connectivity
                    The art was often distributed and social, relying on email lists, web browsers, and hyperlinks to
                    create a "networked" experience. This enabled global reach and fostered collaboration, as seen in
                    projects shared across distributed, international communities. </li>
            </ul>

        </li>


        <li> Use of web 1.0

            <ul>
                <li>Use of "Web 1.0" Aesthetics and Code
                    Artists often used the raw tools of the early internet—basic HTML code, browser frames, glitch
                    aesthetics, and early graphic user interfaces—as their medium. Examples include the chaotic,
                    anti-aesthetic, and deconstructive work of collective JODI, which treated code and error messages as
                    art. </li>
            </ul>

        </li>

        <ol> SUBVERSION OF INSTITUIONS AND COMMERCIALSM

            <ol>
                <li>Early internet art required the viewer to become a participant, often transforming passive browsing
                    into active engagement. Works were rarely static; they were designed to be clicked, manipulated, or
                    altered by the user, making the audience a part of the creative process.</li>
            </ol>
